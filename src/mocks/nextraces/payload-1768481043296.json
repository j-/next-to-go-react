Prominent showing expected and won't be far off them. QUEEN OF ICE (4) Amongst the placegetters when 2nd last time here and carrying less weight this time. In good racing form since resuming from a spell. Suitably placed in this race. CIUDAD JUAREZ (5) Ran 9th last time at this track. Happy to forgive that run and promising career start. Will try to take advantage of the draw. One of the hopes. PENSIEROSA (6) Got the upper hand late when winning last start at this venue and goes down in weight. Has not missed the money this preparation in 2 attempts. Solid place bet prospects.",
