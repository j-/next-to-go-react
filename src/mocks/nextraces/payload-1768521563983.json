BLACK APPETITE (6) has mixed form but was in the money three back and wasn't far away last time at this track when fourth (19.80) in a Bottom Up - Grade 5. Well placed here and can atone this time. BE A BEAUTY (7) has some solid form under her belt and proved too strong last time to win by 0.6 lengths at this track in a handy 17.07 beating Chubby Sammy. Leading chance again. DUNSMORE FLYER (4) was in the money last start here at this trip - likely to feature again.",
