Has ability and looks hard to stop. BLACKBOY LIZZY (1) rocketed out of the inside draw with a scorching early sectional but swamped late when a close up fifth (30.47) at this track over 500m. Leading chance. THEQUIETMAN (4) has been a little hard to follow, finishing out of the placings latest but was in winning form two back scoring in a HCP at this track. Expected to do much better this time. DOTTIES IMAGE (2) can improve on an unplaced run here last time out.",
